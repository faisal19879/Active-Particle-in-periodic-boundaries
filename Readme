My Bachelors in Physics Senior Project carried out at Bilkent University from September 2018  to May 2019. 

Developed relationships for the motion of Active Particles in different geometries and in the presence of
obstacles and made simulations of the model in Matlab for visualization and verification. I have included 
the official report which has all of the details.
